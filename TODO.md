white isn't working

add secondaries to test list

when you get them all right, show original config, but make the squares glow

<!-- when an original box disappears, show it at 50% -->

when you do something wrong (wrong color or wrong shape), it fritzes out

for hard puzzles, inventory is missing. take hint => efficiency goes down

decide on a discrete order thorugh the puzzles.
