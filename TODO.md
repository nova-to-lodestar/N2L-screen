# TODO

fix blue circle. don't make it turn on by itself. just lines. (or train people properly)

2nd tier: don't use JUST solid secondary, instead: use primaries and where they overlap, show secondary

when you get them all right, show original config, but make the squares glow

when an original box disappears, show it at 50%

when you do something wrong (wrong color or wrong shape), it fritzes out

when you use a shape, the shape appears in the interface, in that square, until you turn it off

for hard puzzles, inventory is missing. take hint => efficiency goes down

decide on a discrete order thorugh the puzzles.
