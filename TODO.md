when you get them all right, show original config, but make the squares glow

when you do something wrong (wrong color or wrong shape), it fritzes out

when use a mineral, knock out that shape in the inventory

fix yellow tetra when shoving things off the screen

last ry is broken?

white 5 is broken

## maybe

when an original box disappears, show it at 50%
